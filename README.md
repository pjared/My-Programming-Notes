# My-Programming-Notes
## A collection of the topics i've revisited to further understanding programming

For anyone reading this(other than myself), I have realized that now that I am starting my own projects I know almost nothing about programming other than pressing a "run" button in an IDE. I have decided to revisit all topics to find strengthen my understanding and make new insights, now that I've spent some time failing at programming on my own. This is basically a blog.

The topics have been listed in the "TODO" section.
